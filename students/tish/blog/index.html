  <h1> Don't Make Me Think. </h1>

    What did I think?

      “It doesn’t matter how many times I have to click, as long as each click is a mindless, unambiguous choice.”
 <p>
   I found 'Don’t make me think' to be enlightening and relatable. I think Steve Krug makes the topic of web usability entertaing and interesting using a light writing style to make it accessible for everyone (including me) which is going to come in use throughout this “Coding for Creatives” course. The first 5 chapters are logical and concise and I found the number of examples to illustrate his points great! I’m glad Steve Krug had assured me it isn’t rocket surgery and just common sense. As an Art Director I found the Billboard 101 chapter the most relatable and I hope to be able to make some cool looking sites using code really really soon.

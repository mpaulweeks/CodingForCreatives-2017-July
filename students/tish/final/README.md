[Assignment details](/homework/final)

My plans for my final project is to create an interactive website which I can use for my personal Project. The webiste is basically a donation page and will need

1. Somewhere to Donate money via typing in card details 
2. counter of money raised and people who have donated 
3. various pages desciribing the idea with Text and Photos (and possibly music and video)
4. Styling (style.css)

## Paul's Response

Interesting idea.

Adding a donate button (or even link) is doable, though displaying the total might be tricky.

We can discuss why in class.

  <h2> Don't Make Me Think Notes </h2>
  <ul class="flex">

         This week I read five chapters of "Don't Make Me Think," by Steve Krug. He stresses his motto: "don't make me think." Go figure.
        </p>

          Essentially, webpages should be intuitive; you shouldn't be trying to figure what goes where or confused by what you're seeing. They can be intuitive by using good:
        </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li>Design Elements Such as Heirarchy</li>
              <li>Concise Language <del>and Eliminating Extra Words</del></li>
              <li>Being intuitive</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The reason we want to be this way is because much like "good lighting in a museum," when websites are designed right, it makes everything seem better.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's also a lot of emphasis on the fact that humans tend to "scan" websites, <b>not</b> read them. Humans don't go over every single option and then carefully click the best one - they find the first closest option that they can, then go with that (satisficing).
            </P>

              What are your thoughts on the book?

              <p><h3>
                POST YOUR COMMENTS BELOW FAM
            </p></h3>
            <p><div class="tiny">
              do people still say "fam...?"
            </div></p>
    </span>
    <form id="comments-form">

        <textarea name="text" rows="5" placeholder="...and whatcha thunkin'?"></textarea>
        <br><button type ="submit" class="button">Go!</button></br>
      </div>

  </li>

I want to create a reactionary donald trump page where he yells things like "bad!" "unfair!" at the user. maybe call it a "donald trump advice bot" or something like that!

## Paul's Response

Very interesting!

For first week, try to make the designed page. Then you can spend the remaining time fleshing out the javascript as much as time allows.

Think about the exact UX you want, ie how the user will interaction with Trump (clicking and/or typing), and how he will respond (text and/or audio).

<h1>
  I'm Sofía. My friends call me Sof.
</h1>
<h2>
  Besides this whole advertising thing, I'm into classic rock, Corona, K-Dramas, fashion, film photography, skincare, and Helvetica Neue Ultra Light.  I’ve watched Sex and the City so many times that I catch myself narrating my life in SJP’s voice and I'm in a Paul McCartney concert DVD six times. I say "dude" a lot and have an impeccable vinyl collection.

  I don't take up much space and will occasionally make you laugh if your sense of humor is broken.

  Oh yeah, did I mention I'm in a Paul McCartney concert DVD six times?

<h2> I really enjoyed reading the first five chapters of Steve Krug’s “Don’t Make Me Think”. I really learned a lot about website design and didn’t know how much needs to be considered to effectively design a webpage. Three things I learned from the reading are UX designers design pages with the intent of the user just scanning them, what conventions are and the multiple examples of them, and to make it obvious what’s clickable. Super important tidbits I can use in my future website design. <h2>

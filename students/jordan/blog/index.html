      <h1> Jordan Blogberg's Brom </h1>
      <h3> I was pleased to discover that the simple, straight-forward language in “Don’t Make Me Think” by Steve Krug carried beyond the title and into the text. Krug offered an informative, yet informal, explanation of user experience revolving around the idea that users are reluctant to put too much thought into what could and should come easily and intuitively. This was a reminder to me as an art director that, while innovative and unique design can be impactful, unfamiliar navigation experiences can leave users more frustrated and confused than awestruck and entertained. While frustrated users may continue attempting to navigate a frustrating site rather than leaving it for another, a positive user experience means happier consumers with an inclination to favor and return to your site. Similarly, too much text, regardless of how well-written it may be, can distract readers. Most users scan pages of text in search of the word or phrase that applies to their needs or interests in that moment. For this reason, designs must facilitate quick scanning rather than careful reading. Overall, effective designs include concise wording, emphasization of popularly accessed information, and an intuitive setup.

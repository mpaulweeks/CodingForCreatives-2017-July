[Assignment details](/homework/final)
For the final assignment, I am hoping to roughly redesign the Miami Ad School website. I find the User Experience to be poor, as do prospective students, the primary users of the site. The website is confusing, busy and outdated. Current photos of the actual NYC location are not provided. There is no way to save your application and return to the site to complete it. One must provide an email address and interest area in order to view the application requirements, which means receiving three of the exact same MAS emails every week for eternity. The website provides even less for MAS students; in fact, it is essentially useless for current students. Every instructor has to find their own platform to share lectures, accept assignments and communicate with students, leading to confusion and way too many bookmarked pages for students. Why can't the school website provide an intranet feature to provide the services students and instructors need? Communication at MAS needs to be improved, and the MAS website is a perfect platform to facilitate that communication. A simple well-designed site with a good user experience will more positively represent a school that is supposed to be a leader in teaching design, user experience and marketing - among other things.

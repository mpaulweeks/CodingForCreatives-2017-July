    When most people think of raccoons, they picture wild creatures digging through trash cans late at night. But Pumpkin, a raccoon rescued, prefers eating watermelon, cuddling with the family dogs and using the toilet in her air-conditioned home in the Bahamas.
<br />
<br />
    As a baby, Pumpkin the Raccoon was abandoned by her parents after falling out of a tree and breaking her leg. Taken in by a family with two rescue dogs, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BYYSRhPBGUE/?taken-by=pumpkintheraccoon">Toffee</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BUrc0kXhHKg/?taken-by=pumpkintheraccoon">Oreo</a>, Pumpkin gained a new set of "parents" and a life of luxury in the Bahamas.
<br />
<br />
    Now Pumpkin lives appears to be as happy as can be. Her adventures are chronicled on herÂ Instagram account, where her family post photos of Pumpkin's daily life.

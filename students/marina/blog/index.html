    <p> <i>Don’t Make Me Think</i> is a great book written by Steve Krug that help to understand the principles of intuitive navigation and information design of web usability. </p>
    <p> Krug uses plain language to describe how to make things easy to use, which makes life a lot easier for product users.
        Explaining that a website should not make some one think about navigation or what to click on, it should be self-explanatory. Just making everyting seem better. </p>
    <p> This book  also gives great examples of the dos and don’ts of web design.
        It provides great insight in a short amount of pages as to how you can make your website worth viewing. </p>

    <span class="color"><p> Below are three lessons I learned: </p></span>

    <ul>
    <li>People actually scan some of the text, looking for words or phrases that catch their eyes. So, it's necessary to design a page for scanning, not reading.</li>
    <li>Effective visual hierarchies, make it obvious what's clickable and eliminate distractions are important things to make sure users see and understand the page.</li>
    <li>Make mindless choices is one of the most important things you can do to make a site easy to use.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> In my opinion, this book are useful to anyone planning any sort of process which other people will use, not just web pages. </p>

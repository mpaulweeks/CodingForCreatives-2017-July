[Assignment details](/homework/final)

Edit this file via GitHub to describe your plans.

For my final project, I want to create a page that contains all the references and inspirations that I use for my work: website, posters, design templates, photographies, typographies and music. Visitors will be able to interact with the content: zoom in on images, expand them and be able to comment and like the parts that enjoyed the most.

Also, I want to make the website in such a way that itâ€™s easy to add new content in tabs or pages so I can add my future personal project.

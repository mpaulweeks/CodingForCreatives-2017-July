<p>
    The first five chapters of Don’t Make Me Think were very informative on the simple tactics to design an easy user experience for the web.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 1:

	Chapter One focuses on the insight that people do not want to have to think about a website that they are attempting to use. All aspects should be OBVIOUS, SELF EVIDENT, or at least SELF EXPLANATORY. People should not have to strain to get what they want from a website. DON’T push them to the competition!
</p>
<p>
Chapter 2:

	Chapter Two reminds us that the way we think people use websites is often not the reality of how people actually use them. Most people filter information through glancing at it and scanning the page for what they need in particular. We are not always looking for the best answer rather we are looking for the answer that is reasonable and satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 3:

	Chapter three examines specific techniques used to design for scanning. It concentrates on reinforcing the ideas of convention. Conventions are in place for a reason and often reinforce layout that people are used to and expect. No one should be trying to reinvent the wheel. These conventions deal with standard formatting, hierarchy, and noise reduction. Basically:
 	Keep the design simple
	Size demonstrates importance
	Break things up logically
	Reduce the noise
</p>
<p>
Chapter 4:

	Chapter 4 deals with Forms and basically reinforces the idea that Forms need to be mindless!
</p>
<p>
Chapter 5:

	Omit words!!!!!!!! Being to wordy and too much of an explanation just causes noise and clutter and overwhelms the design. Cut out as much as possible.

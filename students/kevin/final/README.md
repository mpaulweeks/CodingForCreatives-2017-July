[Assignment details](/homework/final)

Finally! For my final I would like to put togethere a sinmple portfolio that can highlight some of my current side projects and projects from my past jobs working in television and editorail. These would be images and slideshows with a brief explination of each project. I would also like to build out the features that would allow me to easily drop in new work for more advertising specific projects that I hope to complete within the next few quarters.

## Paul's Response

Should be doable, I expect a lot of polish when it comes to consistent styling across pages.

Make a sketch markup of the structure of your site in class and we can review it together near the end.

## Week 8

Portfolio site, where individual pages/companies had a slideshow page

Start with header, use shell pages with "Coming soon" for anything to flesh out later

Floating button for contact info, ensure that when expanded is readable

Evenly spaced rows of images that link to slideshow pages

Add hover state for images to indicate they are clickable
```css
.image {
  width: 50px;
}
.image:hover {
  width: 60px;
  border: 2px solid pink;
}
```

For next week:
- Landing page with spaced images
- One working slideshow page

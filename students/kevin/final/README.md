Finally! For my final I would like to put togethere a sinmple portfolio that can highlight some of my current side projects and projects from my past jobs working in television and editorail. These would be images and slideshows with a brief explination of each project. I would also like to build out the features that would allow me to easily drop in new work for more advertising specific projects that I hope to complete within the next few quarters.

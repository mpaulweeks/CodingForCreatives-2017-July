[Assignment details](/homework/final)

Finally! For my final I would like to put togethere a sinmple portfolio that can highlight some of my current side projects and projects from my past jobs working in television and editorail. These would be images and slideshows with a brief explination of each project. I would also like to build out the features that would allow me to easily drop in new work for more advertising specific projects that I hope to complete within the next few quarters.

## Paul's Response

Should be doable, I expect a lot of polish when it comes to consistent styling across pages.

Make a sketch markup of the structure of your site in class and we can review it together near the end.

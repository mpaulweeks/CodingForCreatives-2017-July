## Week 8

Four main html files: index, about, work, personal

These four pages should all be able to link to each other (minus index) via <a> tags

Additional pages for subcategories, eg: soundcloud, dollarshave

Each subcategory should have a "Return to works"-type link

One CSS file for everything

Polish the shit out of it

For next week:
- Make the index

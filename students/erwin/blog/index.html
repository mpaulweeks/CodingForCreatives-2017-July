<p class="dirrty"><br>Whenever I’m on the road, I try to pick up a book to keep me occupied. You might think that I’m all glam and a “diva”, but I do love reading about how to make a site. (Yes, I made this!) Maybe in between studio albums, I can make some extra dough as a website designer! If you’re a newbie like me, check out “Don’t make me think” by Steve Krug.
</p><p>The first five chapters are fairly straight-forward. Krug stresses out that you don’t want to frustrate your visitors by making them THINK. This reminds me when I had to simplify my songs and dumb it down (GENIE IN A BOTTLE). Keeping it simple is key, because it reduces the noise level of the page and allowing the users to see more of the page.
<p>Thanks again for stopping by and remember, keep it clean, obvious, and universal for web design....but stay dirrty and stretch dem notes on stage LOL!!</p>

  <p> Hi! It's your girl, Xtina! Welcome to my page!<br>
    This is only for my fans, who obviously have good set of ears, and who
    truly appreciate REAL ARTISTRY.</br>
  </p>

  <p>
  As a six time Grammy winner (I know I deserved more, right? lol) I feel that
  it's my responsibility to spread this God-given talent to those who seek it.<br></br>
  So if you have any questions about how to hold and stretch a note effortlessly, I'm your gal <3
  </p>
  <p>
    So you ready to get DIRRTY?

  <h1> You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. </h1>
  <h3> And unfortunetly my opinion is not that informed ragarding UX an UI,
    but thanks to those paragraphs i just read i'll try to formulate what i have undrestood from a designer point of view.
  </h3>
  <h2>
    Keep it clean, easy, and efficient.

    <p>
     People don't like thinking even when they are looking at a food menu.
        Our job is to make their choice so obvious that they don't think about it even once.
        question is: How?
      </p>
   <h2>
     Lower you expectations and you will not be disppointed
   </h2>
   <p>
     Understanding how people will truly interact with your website is important.
     They will not care about or read all the fancy things that you put there to make it look cool.
     Or at least they shouldn't be in their way.
     Simply put, find the coolest way to make it look easy to scan.

   <h2>
     Nobody knows that it's called hamburger, but everyone knows what it does.
   </h2>
   <p>
   Conventions and icons might be boring but they are useful. I can change the color of an hamburger icon but i better not put an M as an icon for menu, or people
   will not know what to do with it.
   Also some hierarchy and organization may help, remember what Doc told us 14 times and you should be fine.
 </p>
 <h2>
   Thinking requires effort, clicking doesn't.
 </h2>
 <p>
 It's true that when I land on a website I want to get to my final destination in the fastest way possible.
 But even more important is to get there in the easiest way possible.
 As long as i immediatly know the answer to a question i can keep answering, but if your only question is :to be or not to be? Dude, you lost me.

   Write less

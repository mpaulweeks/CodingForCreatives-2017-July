[Assignment details](/homework/final)

My idea for the final prj is quite simple.
i'd like to make a web page on which you can see series of images scrolling and you can vote the one you like the most.
the "likes" should remain on the page even after leaving it so i can check the opinions afterwards at home.
buttons to switch back and forth the images will be required.
a nice theme song will help too.
last but not list a comment section under each image.
you hit a button image swipe right and comment and likes of that image appears (z=0/1?)
pop up that stays on top of the right ottom corner with insta and portfolio.

## Paul's Response

Really interesting idea, though the storing of state introduced a few wrinkles.

I will make it part of the lecture tomorrow, and then we can discuss what makes sense as a compromise for your site.

## Week 8

Portfolio + Slides combo, where each slide has info/picture/comments/etc

TODO Lorenzo: get copy/images all set

UPDATE: See [jsonbin](/wip/jsonbin) code, brittle but better comments solution

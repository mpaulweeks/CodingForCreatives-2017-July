    <h1> Rebecca Writes About Other People's Writing </h1>

    <p> This book demanded I not make it think, and then it made me think. That kinda pissed me off a bit. In the end I appreciated the oximoronic nature of it, though. Kudos Steve.

      Regardless, it had some interesting thigns to say. While the idea that people don't like to be made to overthink when it comes to user experience, I do think that Mr. Krug had an interesting breakdown of the individual experience while navigating a site. The case for using conventional calls to action or even visual displays makes sense. I found this to be a particularly important reminder, as, in the world of art direction, I beleive people have the tendency to feel like they need to reinvent the wheel. They need to make something, or show something, that people havent seen before. But being original or inventive in ways that break with tried and true conventions isn't always what's going to work best for you user. It might just be confusing. That's all. And then there goes the appreciation of your artistry. What seems counter intuitive is that users actually DO remain on the site despite their frustration and despite the fact that the site;'s competitor is only one literal click away. While this idea seems to take the pressure off the imperitive nature of proper user expereince- it really doesn't. And why? Because people will still be frustrated- and frustrated consumers are not the best consumers to have. We know this.

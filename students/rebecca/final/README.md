[Assignment details](/homework/final)

For my final project Iâ€™d like to make a sight I could link to my portfolio that would showcase a personal project I worked on a few years ago. The project is a series of photographs and poems that were made into 5 small booklets and a photobook. I would use the site to share a blurb about the project, show photos of the booklets and the process in which they were created, and an interactive ebook of the photobook that would allow views to flip through the pages. 

I think this should all be feasible given the skills we have learned through the portfolio lesson and the interactive but would definitely need some help with he java for the page transitions and some CSS brushing up. 

Does this seem like enough for the Final Assignment? 

## Paul's Response

That sounds like a great idea.

Let's discuss 1-on-1 in class whether it makes sense to do with one page or multiple, and the pros/cons therein.

## Week 8

Normal HTML page, relative positions.

Creat carousel by making all "pages" CSS `display: none;`, and then add/remove a class (like in slideshow) to grants it `display: block;`

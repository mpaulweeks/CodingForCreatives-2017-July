Tags

- `<span> ... </span>` useful for styling within other tags
- `<div> ... </div>` everything inside is on its own row
- `<p> ... </p>` everything inside is in a paragraph, with space above and below
- `<a href="link"> ... </a>` everything inside is clickable, send you to a webpage
- `<img src="link" />` display an image
- `<br/>` creates a newline (often used within a paragraph)
- `<hr/>` creates a newline with a horizontal stroke through it, matching the width of the parent tag

Attributes are what go next to tags, within the carrots `<>`

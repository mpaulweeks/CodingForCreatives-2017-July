# The Final Project

## Week 7 - Drafting an Idea

Deadline: 5pm on Sunday, November 19

- Modify the `README.md` in your folder to describe your final project

The goal is to have something written down we can discuss, and I can tell you ahead of time if it's too modest / difficult.

## Week 8 - Begin prototyping

Deadline: 5pm on Sunday, November 26

- Upload at least 1 file of code, as a progress report

This is so I can get a picture of the direction you're taking, and we can discuss technical challenges.

This is also when I'll set explicit requirements for each individual project.

## Week 9 - Submit the Final Project

Deadline: 5pm on Sunday, December 3rd

- Upload your completed project by 5pm so I can review it before we do demos the next day in class.

Each project's requirements will vary based on the job they're trying to tackle, but all of them must satisfy at least these criteria:

- One `index.html` file
- One `CSS` file
- One or more `JS` files
- Each `HTML` file must have a `<title>` and `<favicon>`
- All links/images must work
- No javascript errors during expected use

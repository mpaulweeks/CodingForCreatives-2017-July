## Assignment

Create a series of HTML pages with a shared navigation bar.

Requirements:
- At least four HTML pages
- One style sheet, imported by all the HTML pages
- Each HTML page should have a navigation bar at the top. All pages should be reachable from each other.
- Styling should change on smaller screens (600px is recommended but feel free to experiment)
  - I will be verifying this by loading the website on a phone. I encourage you to try the same.

Upload the following to `students/<yourname>/portfolio/` by 5pm on Sunday, October 22
- `index.html`
- three or more additional `html` files that are named appropriately
- a `css` file for styling

## Tips
- Look at the examples from class
- Experiment with different `text-align` options in your navigation bar
- Experiment with different `border-style` and `padding` options for your art
- Test the `@media` changes by dragging your window smaller and larger

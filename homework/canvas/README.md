## Assignment

Use javascript and the canvas to draw a picture.

Requirements:
- Use all of the shapes (ellipse, rectangle, line, triangle) to draw a picture.
- Use variables to store and re-use your colors and/or numbers.

Upload the following to `students/<yourname>/canvas/` by 5pm on Sunday, October 29
- `index.html`
- a `css` file to specify the dimensions of your canvas
- a `js` file for drawing the picture

## Tips
- Guide on how to use [CFC.NewCanvas()](canvas.md)
- Set your `<canvas>` width/height with CSS, and make sure you use pixels (not percent)
- Strings, like colors, needs quotes around them like `"this"`, but variable names like `canvas` don't.
- Totally stuck? Try inspecting the page and checking the Console for errors:

# Homework

Assignments are due at 5pm on the Sunday before class.

You are welcome to keep making tweaks afterward, but I will grading based on what is uploaded at the time of the deadline.

This folder and it's subfolders are for detailing the homework assignments and providing examples. Make sure you upload your work in your designated `students` folder.

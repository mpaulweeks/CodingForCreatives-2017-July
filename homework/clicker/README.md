## Assignment

Use javascript to create a ["Cookie Clicker"](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/)-style game.

Requirements:
- User can click something to bake a cookie
- User can click something to purchase a grandma
- Display the following numbers with live updating:
  - your current cookie count
  - your current grandma count
  - how much a grandma costs
- Grandma cost should increase some amount each time one is purchased
- Display 5 unique messages when different milestones are reached
  - Count by "lifetime" cookies, not what they current have in stock
- Add custom styles to buttons and display, add images

Upload the following to `students/<yourname>/canvas/` by 5pm on Sunday, October 29
- `index.html`
- a `css` file to style your displays
- a `js` file to run the game

## Tips
- For HTML ids, use hyphens like `<div id="cookie-clicker"></div>`
- For JS variables, use camel casing like `var cookieCount = 0;`
- Totally stuck? Try inspecting the page and checking the Console for errors:
